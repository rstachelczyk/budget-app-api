Budget history (being able to look at yearly report and see previous budgets since they should be able to be updated monthly)
AKA how can I look at historical data and see what the budget was for that month if it has since changed?

Do I want each user to only have one budget or one budget per account?

Each category should have a budget
Each user should have an overall budget across accounts
Should each account have its own budget?

A budget would need a user id always if the category was getting the user id through the budget
